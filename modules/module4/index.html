            <h2>BIO</h2>
            <p class="bio-paragraph" style="color:black;">
                The group rose to fame with their debut international album, Backstreet Boys (1996). 
                In the following year, they released their second international album Backstreet's Back (1997) 
                along with their self-titled U.S. debut album, which continued the group's success worldwide. <br>
                        
                    They rose to superstardom with their third studio album Millennium (1999) and its follow-up album, 
                Black & Blue (2000). After a two-year hiatus, they regrouped and released a comeback album Never Gone (2005). 
                After the conclusion of the Never Gone Tour in 2006, Richardson left the group to pursue other interests.
                The group then released two albums as a quartet: Unbreakable (2007) and This Is Us (2009).<br>
            
            <h3> 1993–95: Formation and early years </h3>
            <p>Howie Dorough and AJ McLean were natives of Orlando, Florida, who met each other through a mutual vocal coach and later discovered Nick Carter through auditions.[10] The three, realizing that they could harmonize together, decided to form a trio.[10] Cousins Kevin Richardson and Brian Littrell, both from Lexington, Kentucky, sang in local church choirs and festivals when they were children.[10] Richardson moved to Orlando in 1990, where he worked at Walt Disney World and concentrated on music at night. Eventually, he met Dorough, Carter, and McLean through a co-worker, and the four decided to form a group.[10]
            In 1992 Lou Pearlman placed an ad in the Orlando Sentinel to compose a vocal group.[11] McLean, who was the first to audition for Pearlman in his living room, became the group's first member.[11] Between late 1992 and March 1993, Pearlman held open casting calls and hundreds of young performers auditioned at his blimp hangar in Kissimmee.[12][11] During late 1992 and March 1993, Carter, Dorough, and Richardson were ultimately selected after meeting Pearlman's expectations.[13] Littrell flew from Kentucky to Orlando to formally join the group on April 20, 1993, a day after receiving a phone call from Richardson about it. Thus, April 20 became their anniversary date.[14] Pearlman decided to call them Backstreet Boys, after Orlando's Backstreet Market, an outdoor flea market near International Drive which was also a teen hangout.[11][15]
            The Backstreet Boys had their first performance at SeaWorld Orlando on May 8, 1993.[16] The group then continued to perform in various venues during summer 1993, from shopping malls, restaurants, to a high-profile charity gala in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.[17] With a change in management in the fall, they began to tour schools across the U.S. (including Littrell's former school, Tates Creek High School), building a fan base while trying to get a record deal. Mercury Records nearly signed them in 1993, but the deal fell through at the last minute because longtime Mercury recording artist John Mellencamp threatened to leave the label if they got into the boy band business.[18] However, in February 1994, Jeff Fenster (then senior VP A&R Zomba/JIVE Records) and David Renzer (then senior VP/GM of Zomba Music Publishing) saw the group performing at a high school in Cleveland, and signed them to their first record deal.[19]
            At the end of December 1994, the group flew to Sweden to record some songs with Max Martin and Denniz PoP, including "We've Got It Goin' On", which ended up being their very first single and completed their work in January 1995.[20] "We've Got It Goin' On" was sent to radio in August 1995 and released as a physical single on September 5, 1995. In North America, Mix 96 in Montreal broke the group after the programmers heard it on the radio in Europe.[21] The song was a minor success in the U.S., peaking at only No. 69 by December 1995,[22] but it entered the top 5 in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, France, and the Netherlands.[23][24] European success sent them there on a summer tour and shifted their promotion being mostly done in Europe.</p>

            <h3>1996–97: Debut, worldwide success, and Backstreet's Back</h3>

            <p>The group finished recording their first album Backstreet Boys in the spring of 1996, and it was released internationally on May 6, 1996,[25] excluding U.S. and Canada; however, it was later released in Canada in October 1996.[26]
            Their popularity grew in Europe. "I'll Never Break Your Heart" reached a Gold status in Germany for selling 250,000 copies[27] and they were voted the No. 1 international group there in 1996. They also earned their first platinum record in Germany in 1996 for selling 500,000 copies of their debut album and shortly thereafter they began touring Asia and Canada.[27] They also became one of the most successful debut artists in the world, collecting awards such as Durchstarter (Best Newcomers) in Germany's Viva Comet Awards in 1996.[28]
            "Anywhere for You" was released as the last single from their international debut album on February 17, 1997.[29] "Quit Playing Games (with My Heart)", originally released in Europe as their fourth single in October 1996, was released in the U.S. in May 1997 for their upcoming self-titled U.S. debut album. It managed to climb as high as No. 4 on Billboard Hot 100, eventually earning them a platinum-award for selling over one million copies.[30][31]
            The group began working on their second album, Backstreet's Back, in October 1996. They also recorded the song "If You Stay" for the Booty Call soundtrack in the same year, which was released in February 1997. Backstreet's Back was released internationally (except in the U.S.) on August 11, 1997. Their self-titled U.S. debut album, which consisted of songs from their 1996 international debut album and Backstreet's Back, was released in the U.S. a day later, August 12, 1997.[32] The U.S. self-titled debut peaked at No. 4 on the U.S. album chart and eventually sold 14 million copies.[33] Meanwhile, the second international release, Backstreet's Back, peaked at No. 1 in Germany, Norway, Switzerland, Finland, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Austria,[34][35] selling well over five million copies in Europe alone.[36] The most successful singles from Backstreet's Back and the U.S. debut album were "Everybody (Backstreet's Back)" and "As Long As You Love Me". The two self-titled albums, the international debut and the U.S. debut, sold more than 28 million copies worldwide.[37]
            In November 1997, doctors discovered that a congenital hole in Littrell's heart had enlarged to dangerous proportions.[38] Littrell postponed the open-heart surgery twice to meet touring obligations, and he finally underwent the surgery on May 8, 1998, in the middle of the Backstreet's Back Tour. The group postponed the tour until July 1998 to give Littrell time to recover.[38]</p>
