    <h4>BIO</h4>
    <p class="bio_content" style="color:black;">
        The group rose to fame with their debut international album, Backstreet Boys (1996). 
        In the following year, they released their second international album Backstreet's Back (1997) 
        along with their self-titled U.S. debut album, which continued the group's success worldwide. <br>
                
            They rose to superstardom with their third studio album Millennium (1999) and its follow-up album, 
        Black & Blue (2000). After a two-year hiatus, they regrouped and released a comeback album Never Gone (2005). 
        After the conclusion of the Never Gone Tour in 2006, Richardson left the group to pursue other interests.
        The group then released two albums as a quartet: Unbreakable (2007) and This Is Us (2009).<br>
